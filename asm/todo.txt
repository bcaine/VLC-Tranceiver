- Determine time taken for DDR access of 100 bytes.
	- Use this to establish the PRU1_Delay constant used for idling 	  in PRU0

- Confirm that LSR/LSL will accept individual bits of R31 as input (saves   instruction cost)
	- If not, instruction cost increases to 3/4 per bit, not a big 	  deal but would prefer not to do this

- Confirm PRU GPIO access works as expected, determine which pins we'd like to use

- Confirm scratchpad XIN/XOUT works as expected, should be interrupt-centric

- Determine clock sync mechanism (!!!)

- Determine the DDR size we will use (PRU/BBB interface)

- Determine any const registers we can take advantage of

- Duly confirm the RX/TX PRU1 interface will work as expected



- Finally, type out the entire loop (100 bytes..) to save instruction cost, and double check that this file size will fit in PRU instruction memory
